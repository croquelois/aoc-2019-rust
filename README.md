Advent of code 2019 - Rust

This year for the Advent of Code, I've decided to learn Rust.

It was an amazing journey full of dicovery. I've enjoyed the **borrowing**, the **traits**, `cargo` is a powerful tool and the compiler is so smart ! After spending my day figthing gcc at work, it was a pleasure to see some precise and concise compilation error.

This repository contain the code used for solve the 25 challenges.
